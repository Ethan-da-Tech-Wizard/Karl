# Karl — Scope Lock & Milestones

## Scope Statement

Karl is a self-contained, offline LLM **Introspection Environment** for prompt engineers.

Core invariants that must never be compromised:
- Zero network calls during inference
- Every generation is immutably logged
- The hackable core (`core/`) is always hot-reloadable without restart
- Privacy: no telemetry, no remote model servers, no localhost proxies

---

## Completed Milestones

### ✅ M1 — Headless Introspection Engine
**Files:** `engine_test.py`, `core/cognitive_parser.py`, `app/utils/trace_logger.py`

Proved the engine works and established the raw logging infrastructure.
`TraceLogger` writes structured JSONL to `data/logs/traces/`. `cognitive_parser.py`
batch-parses `<think>` blocks from raw output.

---

### ✅ M2 — Streaming Thought/Response Split UI
**Files:** `app/engine/llm_thread.py`, `app/engine/agentic_thread.py`

Inline streaming state machine in both threads routes tokens to the correct display:
- `<think>` → `new_thought_token` signal → reasoning panel
- after `</think>` → `new_chat_token` signal → response panel
- suffix guard prevents flushing partial tags across chunk boundaries
- auto-continuation: if `finish_reason == "length"`, re-queries up to 5 passes

---

### ✅ M3 — Memory & Context Management
**Files:** `app/utils/memory_manager.py`, both threads

`MemoryManager` serialises chat history as JSON. `_trim_history()` in both threads
enforces character budget `(n_ctx - 1024) * 3` and always preserves the seed message.

---

### ✅ M4 — Universal RAG Pipeline
**Files:** `app/utils/rag_pipeline.py`

Persistent FAISS flat L2 index. Embeddings via `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
Formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, PY, MD, CSV. 200-word chunks / 50-word overlap.
Retrieval eval metrics: hit@1, hit@3, hit@k, reciprocal rank.
Index persists across restarts at `data/vector_db/`.

---

### ✅ M5 — Hackable Core Decoupling
**Files:** `core/interaction_loop.py`, `importlib.reload()` in both threads

All prompt construction in `core/interaction_loop.py`. Both threads call
`importlib.reload()` before every generation. User edits the file → clicks
Generate → new logic runs immediately. No restart.

---

### ✅ M6 — Agentic Loop
**Files:** `core/agentic_loop.py`, `app/engine/agentic_thread.py`

`AgenticThread` loops: generate → parse → check stop → inject next prompt → repeat.
`should_continue()` and `build_next_prompt()` hot-reloaded per iteration.
Hard cap: `MAX_ITERATIONS = 20`.

---

### ✅ M7 — Raw Token Archive
**Files:** `app/engine/llm_thread.py`, `app/engine/agentic_thread.py`

Every token emitted via `new_raw_token` before the parser sees it.
Each generation writes a micro-timestamped `.tokens` file to `data/logs/raw/`.
Data persists even if generation is killed mid-stream.

---

### ✅ M8 — Hardware Scout & Model Registry
**Files:** `core/hardware_scout.py`, `data/model_registry.json`

`get_hardware_profile()` reads RAM, VRAM, storage.
`data/model_registry.json` defines 4 model tiers with RAM requirements and
context window sizes (4096 → 8192 → 16384 → 32768).
Note: self-upgrade functionality has been permanently removed (see M10 below).

---

### ✅ M9 — Auto-Loop Mode
**Files:** `app/ui/workspaces/workbench.py`

Loop checkbox in Workbench. When checked, send spawns `AgenticThread` instead
of `LLMThread`. Stop button sends `request_stop()` to the running thread.

---

### ~~M10 — Self-Upgrade Git Push~~ — REMOVED
`app/engine/upgrade_manager.py` has been permanently deleted.
Self-upgrade was cut because it introduced fragile git subprocess calls and
a push-conflict risk with no rollback. Hardware detection and model registry
remain (M8); automatic downloading will be reimplemented in Phase 3.4.

---

### ✅ M11 — Training Data Curator
**Files:** `app/utils/training_curator.py`, `app/ui/workspaces/workbench.py`

👍 Good response → `curator.save_example(source="thumbs_up")`.
✎ Correct response → user edits → saved as `source="corrected"`.
All data in `data/training/curated.jsonl` in Unsloth SFT format.

---

### ✅ M12 — Eval Harness
**Files:** `eval/harness.py`, `eval/graders.py`, `eval/run_eval.py`

5 graders: `exact_match`, `json_valid`, `keyword_hit`, `groundedness`, `not_in_context`.
CLI: `python eval/run_eval.py --dataset path/to/dataset.jsonl`.
Dry-run mode tests graders without model.

---

### ✅ M13 — Workflow Modes & Prompt Templates
**Files:** `core/workflows.py`, `core/prompt_templates.py`

4 workflows: `general_chat`, `document_extractor`, `grounded_answer`, `code_review`.
5 templates: `reasoning_minimal`, `gpt_structured`, `json_extractor`, `grounded_answer`, `code_review`.
Workflow selector in Workbench combo box.

---

### ✅ M14 — RAG Hardening
**Files:** `app/utils/rag_pipeline.py`

Persistent FAISS index with file-level metadata. Optional contextual chunk headers.
`source_filter` on `retrieve()`. Retrieval eval metrics built in.

---

### ✅ M15 — Training Path Formalisation
**Files:** `training/validate_dataset.py`, `training/qlora_config_template.yaml`, `training/WHEN_TO_TUNE.md`

`validate_dataset.py` validates curated JSONL before training.
`qlora_config_template.yaml` ready for Unsloth.
`WHEN_TO_TUNE.md` decision guide.

---

### ✅ M16 — Multi-Workspace UI Rebuild
**Files:** `app/ui/`, `app/state.py`

Replaced two-page layout with sidebar + 6-workspace architecture.
Sidebar: Workbench, Prompt Lab, Knowledge Base, Training Studio, Eval Suite, System.
`AppState` shared state container. Single dark design system (`themes.py`).
`StatusBar`: always shows model name, generation state, RAM usage.

---

### ✅ M17 — Foundation Hardening
**Files:** `app/engine/model_loader.py`, `core/cognitive_parser.py`, `app/utils/trace_logger.py`

- `ModelLoader`: `threading.Lock()` eliminates race condition on `get_instance()`
- `cognitive_parser`: state machine replaces `str.split()`; handles any tag casing,
  multiple blocks, unclosed tags
- `trace_logger`: new Unsloth-compatible schema (`id`, `session_id`, `feedback`,
  `corrected_response`, `model`, `adapter`, `timing`); 50 MB log rotation

---

## Remaining Work — Phase Plan

The phases below must be executed in strict order.
Each phase has a defined scope, commit strategy, and risk level.

---

### Phase 1 — Wire It Together
**Strategy:** Single commit. All 6 items are targeted bug fixes in existing files.
No new components. No architecture changes.
**Risk:** Low.

| # | Task | File(s) |
|---|------|---------|
| 1.1 | Fix trace_logger call in LLMThread: pass `model_name`, `adapter_name`, `workflow`, `template` | `app/engine/llm_thread.py` |
| 1.2 | Fix trace_logger call in AgenticThread: same + fix synthetic `rag_context` | `app/engine/agentic_thread.py` |
| 1.3 | Model-aware context budget: `ModelLoader` reads `n_ctx` from `model_registry.json`; threads read from `ModelLoader` | `app/engine/model_loader.py`, both threads |
| 1.4 | Strip `<think>` blocks in `memory_manager.save_session()` | `app/utils/memory_manager.py` |
| 1.5 | Eval harness model guard: check `ModelLoader.is_loaded()` at top of `run()`; implement `progress_cb` call in case loop | `eval/harness.py` |
| 1.6 | Workbench params drawer: collapsible widget above input exposing temperature, top-p, max-tokens | `app/ui/workspaces/workbench.py` |

**Exit criteria:** All 6 items complete, tests pass, single clean commit.

---

### Phase 2 — Complete the Data Pipeline
**Strategy:** Single commit. All items wire existing components together.
**Risk:** Low-Medium.

| # | Task | File(s) |
|---|------|---------|
| 2.1 | Add `rag_threshold` and `rag_top_k` to `AppState`; KB workspace writes them; Workbench reads them at retrieve() | `app/state.py`, `knowledge_base.py`, `workbench.py` |
| 2.2 | Add thumbs-down button to Workbench feedback row; wire to `curator.save_example(source="thumbs_down")` | `app/ui/workspaces/workbench.py`, `app/utils/training_curator.py` |
| 2.3 | Connect `MemoryManager` to Workbench: sessions list panel, save on new session, load on click | `app/ui/workspaces/workbench.py` |
| 2.4 | Update `feedback` field in trace log when user rates a generation | `app/engine/llm_thread.py`, `app/ui/workspaces/workbench.py` |
| 2.5 | Normalise `training_curator.export_unsloth()` return to path string only (remove tuple) | `app/utils/training_curator.py`, `app/ui/workspaces/training_studio.py` |

**Exit criteria:** Full trace → curate → export → Unsloth-ready loop works end-to-end.

---

### Phase 3.1 — Small Workspace Fixes
**Strategy:** Single commit. Mechanical additions to two workspaces.
**Risk:** Low.

| # | Task | File(s) |
|---|------|---------|
| 3.1a | KB workspace: add chunk_size and overlap spinboxes; pass to `ingest_file()` | `app/ui/workspaces/knowledge_base.py` |
| 3.1b | Eval Suite: connect `progress_cb` from `EvalSuiteWorkspace` to `harness.run()` | `eval/harness.py`, `app/ui/workspaces/eval_suite.py` |

---

### Phase 3.2 — Prompt Lab Completion
**Strategy:** Single commit. Self-contained UI feature.
**Risk:** Low-Medium.

| # | Task | File(s) |
|---|------|---------|
| 3.2a | After both A/B runs complete, render character-level diff of the two outputs | `app/ui/workspaces/prompt_lab.py` |
| 3.2b | Save/load named prompt pairs to `data/prompt_pairs/` | `app/ui/workspaces/prompt_lab.py` |

---

### Phase 3.3 — LoRA / QLoRA Training Thread
**Strategy:** Single commit. High-risk; isolated from other Phase 3 work.
**Risk:** High — new threading pattern, HF model dependency, optional deps.

Dependencies: `peft`, `trl`, `transformers`, `datasets`.
HF model weights must be present in `data/hf_models/`.

| # | Task | File(s) |
|---|------|---------|
| 3.3a | Detect HF model in `data/hf_models/`; show clear guide if absent | `app/ui/workspaces/training_studio.py` |
| 3.3b | `TrainingThread(QThread)` running `SFTTrainer` from `trl`; streams loss to log view | `app/ui/workspaces/training_studio.py` |
| 3.3c | Save trained adapter to `data/adapters/<name>/`; load adapter into ModelLoader | `app/engine/model_loader.py`, `app/ui/workspaces/training_studio.py` |
| 3.3d | QLoRA path: if `bitsandbytes` is available, offer 4-bit quantised training | `app/ui/workspaces/training_studio.py` |

**Exit criteria:** Training runs on a 5-example dataset, loss curve visible, adapter saved.

---

### Phase 3.4 — System Config Model Registry
**Strategy:** Single commit. Self-contained workspace enhancement.
**Risk:** Low.

| # | Task | File(s) |
|---|------|---------|
| 3.4a | Read `model_registry.json`; render tier table (name, RAM req, n_ctx, size) | `app/ui/workspaces/system_config.py` |
| 3.4b | Download button per tier: fetch GGUF to `data/models/`, show progress, set active | `app/ui/workspaces/system_config.py`, `app/engine/model_loader.py` |

---

### Phase 4.1 — Tokenizer Visualization
**Strategy:** Single commit. Self-contained display feature.
**Risk:** Low.

Expose `llm.tokenize(text)` from `llama-cpp-python`. Render tokens as colored
spans in a dedicated panel. Lives in Prompt Lab or as a drawer in Workbench.

| # | Task | File(s) |
|---|------|---------|
| 4.1a | Add tokenize panel: text input → token spans with IDs | `app/ui/workspaces/prompt_lab.py` |
| 4.1b | Color tokens by type (punctuation, word, subword, special) | same |

---

### Phase 4.2 — DPO Export Completion
**Strategy:** Single commit. Depends on Phase 2.2 (thumbs-down) being complete.
**Risk:** Low-Medium.

| # | Task | File(s) |
|---|------|---------|
| 4.2a | `training_curator` pairing algorithm: match thumbs-up (chosen) with thumbs-down (rejected) on same prompt | `app/utils/training_curator.py` |
| 4.2b | `export_dpo(path)` produces Unsloth-compatible DPO JSONL: `{prompt, chosen, rejected}` | `app/utils/training_curator.py`, `app/ui/workspaces/training_studio.py` |

**Exit criteria:** Exported DPO file loadable by Unsloth without modification.

---

### Phase 4.3 — Session Branching
**Strategy:** Single commit. Architecturally significant — isolated for safety.
**Risk:** High — changes `chat_history` from `list[dict]` to a tree structure.

This is the most architecturally complex item in the plan. `chat_history` currently
lives in `WorkbenchWorkspace` as a flat list. Branching requires it to become a tree
where each node can have multiple child turns. Plan carefully before touching code.

| # | Task | File(s) |
|---|------|---------|
| 4.3a | Design `SessionTree` data structure: node = `{role, content, children[], id}` | new `app/utils/session_tree.py` |
| 4.3b | Replace flat `chat_history` list in `WorkbenchWorkspace` with `SessionTree` | `app/ui/workspaces/workbench.py` |
| 4.3c | "Branch from here" action on any message in chat view | `app/ui/workspaces/workbench.py` |
| 4.3d | Branch navigator: show tree of branches, switch between them | `app/ui/workspaces/workbench.py` |
| 4.3e | `MemoryManager` serialise/deserialise `SessionTree` | `app/utils/memory_manager.py` |

**Exit criteria:** User can fork any message, explore alternate path, return to original.

---

### Phase 5 — Documentation, Tests, Accuracy
**Strategy:** Single commit. No code risk.
**Risk:** None.

| # | Task | File(s) |
|---|------|---------|
| 5.1 | Rewrite `README.md` for Linux/Arch: remove all PowerShell, add Arch-specific install | `README.md` |
| 5.2 | Rewrite all 7 `docs/` files to match current architecture | `docs/01–07` |
| 5.3 | Update `AGENTS.md` to reflect final completed state | `AGENTS.md` |
| 5.4 | Write unit tests: `cognitive_parser`, `trace_logger`, `training_curator` | `tests/` (new) |
| 5.5 | Fix `smoke_test.py` and `engine_test.py` hardcoded model paths | root |
